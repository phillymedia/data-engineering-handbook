# Inquirer Data Engineering Team Handbook

This Handbook is intended to provide all employees a guide to working on the Inquirer's Data Engineering (DE) team. It is a working, living document that will be updated over time as we grow and learn.

You will find much of the content in this Handbook to be high-level, and subject to liberal interpretation and leeway. While this approach empowers our team members, it also means there is a **higher burden of responsibility**. We are trusting and expecting everyone to apply good judgement, and reach out for clarifications or guidance where things aren't clear or obvious. **This Handbook is meant to augment – not replace – good decision-making.**

We've borrowed heavily from [Hex](https://www.notion.so/Hex-Handbook-9fff0d42860e4f70815c599e0d1664d6) and [GitLab's](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/business-technology/data-team/) handbooks in crafting our own. Both companies are exemplary in their efforts to promote impactful behaviors, and we're grateful that they invested the time and effort to write their findings down. We will strive to do the same.

Even though we have borrowed heavily from these sources, we've also thoroughly reviewed the source materials and made edits where necessary to bring the handbook in line with the specifics of working on the Inquirer's Data Engineering team. There are stubs and broken links in this handbook in instances where we haven't yet reviewed the source material for appropriateness. You should feel empowered to augment and iterate on this handbook via pull request.
