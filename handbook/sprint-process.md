## Agile Sprint Process

We observe two-week sprint cycles. Sprints start at 11:00 AM ET on Wednesday, and end two weeks later on Wednesday at 10:00 AM ET.

### Ceremonies

#### Daily Scrum Meeting 

- Cadence: Monday - Thursday, zoom meeting, synchronous, 15 minute timebox 
  
- Agenda: 
  - Each Data Engineer answers three questions:
    - What did you accomplish yesterday?
    - What are you planning to work on today?
    - Are there any blockers impeding your progress?
  - Review of open PRs
  - Triage data model errors and test failures via Elementaryâ€™s Observability Report,  identifying next steps and owners to resolve issues

- Expectations:
  - Punctual participation with transparent and open communication

##### Biweekly/Monthly Scrum Agenda Items

To ensure team alignment and transparency, certain scrum meetings will have additional agenda items, as follows:

- **Monday scrum before sprint launch (biweekly)**
  - Team members evaluate tickets that we anticipate spilling over into the next sprint. In-progress tickets are cloned and re-pointed to reflect estimated spillover work. Tickets with status of To Do or Blocked are rescheduled, as appropriate.
  - Team members may edit the point value of their assigned tickets to better reflect their actual level-of-effort.

- **Tuesday standup before sprint launch (biweekly)**
  - Team review of the upcoming Sprint Planning Log, with a focus on:
    - General epics and work themes
    - Risks
    - OOO and handoff information
    - Special ceremonies (e.g. Dev Day, D&I Demo)

- **Thursday standup, 1 week before D&I Demo day (monthly)**
  - Team members commit to a presentation topic for the following week's D&I Demo session. They may draw from any of their work since the previous D&I Demo.

- **Monday standup, week of Dev Day (monthly)**
  - Team members commit to a Dev Day focus area.
  - Additionally, team members will have an opportunity to discuss their upcoming Dev Day plans during 1:1s with their manager (the week before Dev Day week).

#### Sprint Close, Planning & Launch

- Cadence: Biweekly, on Wednesdays, 1-hour timebox
- Agenda: 
  - Agile Practitioner closes the current sprint addressing any carryover issues
  - Review Sprint Planning Log and estimate sprint capacity
  - Adjust the tickets based on priority and alignment with project goals and capacity
  - Agree on tickets and pre-assign tickets to team members when there is sufficient reason to do so (e.g. only a particular team member can work the ticket; a team member can work a blocked ticket once they complete the in-progress blocker ticket). Otherwise, tickets with a status of "To Do" should generally be unassigned at the start of the sprint
  - Agile Practitioner starts the next sprint
    
- Expectations:
  - All tasks and deliverables from the ending sprint are addressed appropriately
