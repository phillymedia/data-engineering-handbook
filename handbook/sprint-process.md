## Agile Sprint Process

We observe two-week sprint cycles. Sprints start at 11:00 AM ET on Wednesday, and end two weeks later on Wednesday at 10:00 AM ET.

### Ceremonies

#### Daily Scrum Meeting

- Agenda: 
  - Each Data Engineer answers three questions:
    - What did you accomplish yesterday?
    - What are you planning to work on today?
    - Are there any blockers impeding your progress?
  - Review of open PRs
  - Triage data model errors and test failures via Elementaryâ€™s Observability Report,  identifying next steps and owners to resolve issues

#### Sprint Close, Planning & Launch

- Cadence: Biweekly, on Wednesdays, 1-hour timebox
- Agenda: 
  - Agile Practitioner closes the current sprint addressing any carryover issues
  - Review Sprint Planning Log and estimate sprint capacity
  - Adjust the tickets based on priority and alignment with project goals and capacity
  - Agree on tickets and pre-assign tickets to team members when there is sufficient reason to do so (e.g. only a particular team member can work the ticket; a team member can work a blocked ticket once they complete the in-progress blocker ticket). Otherwise, tickets with a status of "To Do" should generally be unassigned at the start of the sprint
