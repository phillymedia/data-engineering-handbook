## Agile Sprint Process

_Currently, we observe an asynchronous daily standup while we design a more comprehensive agile sprint process._

### Ceremonies

#### Daily Data Engineering Standup

- Cadence: Daily, asynchronous
  
- Agenda: Short set of questions administered through a Geekbot Slack app via DM about what you’re doing for the day, and, **more importantly, if you’re blocked on anything**. 
  
We track these standup responses over on the #data-insights-group channel, which is where we'll triage blockers.

This standup is broadcast at 9:00am ET, but you're only expected to respond to it whenever you start your workday. Take 10-15 minutes at the beginning of your day to take inventory of your recent and upcoming work, and the blockers you've encountered. You're encouraged to set an event on your calendar if that helps.
