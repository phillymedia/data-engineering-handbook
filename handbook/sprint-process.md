## Agile Sprint Process

We observe two-week sprint cycles. Sprints start at 2:00pm ET on Tuesday, and end two weeks later on Tuesday at 12:00 ET.

### Ceremonies

#### Daily Data Engineering Standup

- Cadence: Daily, asynchronous
  
- Agenda: Short set of questions administered through a Geekbot Slack app via DM about what you’re doing for the day, and, **more importantly, if you’re blocked on anything**. We track these standup responses over on the #data-insights-group channel, which is where we'll triage blockers.

- Expectations:
  - This standup is broadcast at 9:00am ET, but you're only expected to respond to it whenever you start your workday. Take 10-15 minutes at the beginning of your day to take inventory of your recent and upcoming work, and the blockers you've encountered. You're encouraged to set an event on your calendar if that helps.

#### Sprint Kickoff

- Cadence: Biweekly, on sprint Tuesdays (during the Data Leads meeting)
  
- Agenda: 
  - Given that the upcoming sprint is already pre-populated, the data team leadership accounts for any work that has spilled over from the previous sprint, removing points as necessary to keep the total story points within our team's sprint capacity. 
  - Once this process is complete, the Agile coach starts the new sprint. 


#### Backlog Refinement

- Cadence: Biweekly, on off-sprint Tuesdays
  
- Agenda: The team reviews any unpointed, unblocked tickets. After discussing the ticket, each team member provides a story point estimate for the ticket. When a consensus is reached, that story point value is added to the ticket.

- Expectations:
  - Team members review tickets and add questions and comments to the tickets in advance of refinement to facilitate better team discussions. 


#### Sprint Planning

- Cadence: Biweekly, on off-sprint Tuesdays (during the Data Leads meeting)
  
- Agenda: 
  - Agile coaches provide an estimated sprint capacity for the upcoming sprint. 
  - Data leads populate the sprint with tickets from the top of the backlog until the total story points matches the sprint capacity. 
  - Data leads will send out a curated Confluence page for the sprint no later than 12pm on Wednesday to the rest of the team for review of tickets in upcoming sprint. Issues raised on Confluence or Jira regarding particular tickets or overall work should prompt followup conversations as soon as possible.


#### Sprint Retro and Demos

- Cadence: Biweekly, on sprint Tuesdays
  
- Agenda: 
  - Agile coaches and leads solicit feedback from the team related to the sprint. 
  - Team members demonstrate work they've delivered during the sprint
  - The Agile coach closes the active sprint.

- Expectations:
  - Team members are expected to move tickets into a terminal state (i.e. closed or closed-and-cloned into the next sprint) by the start of Retro.
  - Managers commit to holding team members accountable to this expectation.
