## Communication

Currently, we're an all-remote team, so it's important for us to practice clear communication in ways that help us stay connected and work more efficiently.

To accomplish this, we use <b>[asynchronous communication](/company/culture/all-remote/asynchronous/) as a starting point</b> and stay as open and transparent as we can by communicating through public issues, [pull requests](#everything-starts-with-a-merge-request), and Slack channels.

We also place an emphasis on ensuring that conclusions of offline conversations are written down.
When we go **back and forth three times,** we jump on a [synchronous video call](#video-calls).

We communicate respectfully and professionally at all times.

## Effective & responsible communication guidelines

1. **Assume [Positive Intent](values.md#collaboration).** Always begin with a position of positivity and grace.
1. **Kindness Matters.** You are looking at a screen, but you are really talking to a person. If you wouldn't say it to a person's face, do not send it to them in a text message.
1. **Express Your Thoughts.** We live in different locations and often have very different perspectives. We want to know your thoughts, opinions, and feelings on things.
1. **Own It.** If you say it or type it, own it. If it hurts the company or an individual, even unintentionally, we encourage you to look at things from other points of view and apologize easily.
1. **Be a Role Model of our [Values](values.md).**
2. **Feedback is Essential.**  We encourage team members to give feedback and receive feedback in a considerate way.
3. **Do not underestimate a 1:1.** Asynchronous communication (e.g., via text) is helpful and necessary. In some cases (e.g., to clarify misunderstandings) it can be much more effective to jump on a video call.
4. **Always Adhere to our Anti-Harassment Policy and Inquirer Code of Conduct and Ethics.** [TKTK find out where these are] Everyone should be comfortable in their work environment.
5. **Focus on what we can directly influence.** There are many factors we can't directly influence and we should avoid spending time discussing those things.

Embracing asynchronous communication and learning to use it effectively requires a mental shift. This can feel unusual or even uncomfortable for those who come from a colocated environment, where in-person meetings and communiques are the norm. Learn more about [mastering the use of the written word in an all-remote setting](/company/culture/all-remote/effective-communication/).

## Everyone is a moderator

If you see something that concerns you in Slack, Issues, Pull Requests, Video, Emails or any other forum, we encourage you to respectfully say something directly to the individual in a 1:1 format. If you are not comfortable reaching out to the individual directly, please reach out to your direct manager or People Business Partner to discuss.

## External communication

Key practices to consider during any meeting are listed below.

1. Video Calls - If this is your first time meeting a stakeholder, vendor, employee, or other partner, turn on your camera when you join Zoom/Google Meet. This will help to make the customer/prospect feel more comfortable as they are certain your undivided attention is geared towards them.
2. "No agenda, no attenda" - Always have an [agenda prepped and ready to go](/company/culture/all-remote/live-doc-meetings/), with the exception of purely informal meetings (e.g. social events, virtual happy hours). Share this with your audience. Make sure that everything on the agenda is accurate and ask if there’s anything missing that needs to be addressed during this call or for the future. When there is no agenda, it translates to you not caring.
3. 70/30 Rule - Ask open ended questions that leave the audience talking 70% of the time, while you are talking 30% of the time. Please note that this varies based on the type of meeting that you are conducting. Be conscious of what questions need to be asked and to capture those items.
4. Take Notes - Effective note-taking is a valuable skill that will help you retain and recall any important details. Be the person who remembers all the details of your audience's needs.
5. Adapt to Audience Tone - Before going into the business portion of your meeting, evaluate first the tone of the audience. Adapt your tone accordingly in order to appeal to various types of personalities.
6. Mid-call - Half-way through the meeting, check in with your audience. Ask them what their thoughts are on the progression of this meeting and if what you're presenting is on the right track. This helps both you and the audience by re-aligning expectations and making sure the meeting is going the right direction.
7. Pre-Close Summary - 10 Minutes (1-hour meetings) or 5 minutes (30 minute meetings) prior to ending the call, ask the audience to build out an agenda for the next step or meeting. This helps to secure next steps and to ensure there are no balls dropped.
8. Post Meeting Action - Immediately write down notes and next steps and input into the proper directory.


## Everything starts with a Pull Request

It's best practice to start a discussion where possible with a [Pull Request (PR)](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-pull-requests) instead of an issue. A PR is associated with a specific change that is proposed and transparent for everyone to review and openly discuss. The nature of PRs facilitate discussions around a proposed solution to a problem that is actionable. An PR is actionable, while an issue will take longer to take action on.

1. Always **open** an PR for things you are suggesting and/or proposing. Whether something is not working right or we are iterating on a new internal process, it is worth opening a merge request with the minimal viable change instead of opening an issue encouraging open feedback on the problem without proposing any specific change directly. Remember, a PR also invites discussion, but it's specific to the proposed change which facilitates focused decision.
1. Never ask someone to create an issue when they can default to the pull request.
1. Starting with a Pull Request is part of [Handbook First](/handbook/handbook-usage/#why-handbook-first) and helps ensure the handbook is up-to-date when a decision is made. It is also how we make it possible for everyone to contribute to our platform. This is true, not just for updating the handbook but for updating all things.
2. Not every solution will solve the problem at hand. Keep discussions focused by **defining the problem first** and **explaining your rationale** behind the [Minimal Viable Change (MVC)](values.md#minimal-viable-change-mvc) proposed in the MR.
3. Be proactive and consistent with communication. It's important to keep communication flowing to keep everyone up to date. PRs can appear stale if there aren't recent discussions and no clear definition on when another update will be provided, based on feedback. This leaves those subscribed in the dark, causing unnecessary surprise if something ends up delayed and suddenly jumps to the next milestone. It is important that PRs are closed in a timely manner through approving or rejecting the open requests.
4. Have a **bias for action** and [do not aim for consensus](/handbook/leadership/#making-decisions). Every PR is a [proposal](values.md#make-a-proposal), if an PRs author isn't responsive take ownership of it and complete it. Some improvement is better than none.
5. **Cross link** issues or other PRs with related conversations. E.g. if there’s a Jira ticket or GitHub issue that caused you to create a GitHub.com PR, make sure to document the PR link in the ticket/issue and vice versa. And when approving or rejecting the PR, include reason or response from Zendesk. Put the link at the top of each PR's description with a short mention of the relationship (Report, Dependency, etc.) and use one as the central one and ideally close the alternate if duplicate.
   1. When providing links to specific lines of code relevant to the PR, **always use a permalink** (a link to a specific commit for the file). This ensures that the reference is still valid if the file changes. For more information, see [Link to specific lines of code](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/working-with-advanced-formatting/creating-a-permanent-link-to-a-code-snippet).
6. If submitting a change for a feature, **update the description with the final conclusions** (Why an PR was rejected or why it was approved). This makes it much easier to see the current state of an issue for everyone involved in the implementation and prevents confusion and discussion later on.
7. Submit the **smallest** item of work that makes sense. When proposing a change, submit the smallest reasonable commit, put suggestions for other enhancements in separate issues/PRs and link them. An PR can start off as only a problem description and TODO comments. If you're new to GitHub and are writing documentation or instructions, submit your first merge request for at most 20 lines.
8. Do not leave PRs open for a long time. PRs should be **actionable** -- stakeholders should have a clear understanding of what changed and what they are ultimately approving or rejecting.
9. Make a conscious effort to **prioritize** your work. The priority of items depends on multiple factors: Is someone waiting for the answer? What is the impact if you delay it? How many people does it affect, etc.? This is detailed in [Engineering Work flow](/handbook/engineering/workflow/).
10. When submitting a MVC, **ask for feedback** from your peers. For example, if you're a data engineer and you propose a solution, ping a fellow data engineer to review your work. If they suggest changes, you get the opportunity to improve your solution and propose an alternative PR. This promotes collaboration and advances everyone's skills.
11. Respond to comments within a **threaded discussion**. 
12. If your comment or answer contains separate topics, write separate comments for each, so others can address topics independently.
13. If you have received any feedback or questions on your PR, try to acknowledge comments as [that's how we ensure we create an environment of belonging for all team members](/company/culture/inclusion/#gitlabs-definition-of-diversity-inclusion--belonging). Merging your PR as-is without giving an answer or any response makes the commenters feel their opinions are unheard. If you are the [Directly Responsible Individual](/handbook/people-group/directly-responsible-individuals/) (DRI) who does not have to make a fast decision, you can choose not to change your PR, but you should acknowledge the comments or feedback, consider if they warrant a change to your PR, and [say why, not just what](values.md#say-why-not-just-what).
   If there are many comments, you can choose to summarize key feedback areas and share your response at a high level. We appreciate that [if you force a DRI to explain too much, you'll create incentives to ship projects under the radar. The fear of falling into a perpetual loop of explaining can derail a DRI, and cause people to defer rather than working with a bias for action](/handbook/people-group/directly-responsible-individuals/#empowering-dris). This is something we want to avoid.
   When fast decisions are needed, [we'll have to accept that people listened to us but don't owe us an explanation to have fast decisions based on everyone's input](/handbook/leadership/#making-decisions). The goals are to be transparent and collaborative--not to lose efficiency. Not everyone will agree, but we expect all people to [disagree, commit, and disagree](values.md#disagree-commit-and-disagree).
14. For the Inquirer data platform, the merge request guidelines are in the TKTK [[Contribution
   guide](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/contributing/merge_request_workflow.html#merge-request-guidelines)] and code review guidelines for reviewers and maintainers are described in our [Code Review Guidelines](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/code_review.html).
15. Even when something is not done, share it internally so people can comment early and prevent rework.
16. Create a <b>[Work In Progress (WIP)]</b> merge request to prevent an accidental early merge. Only use WIP when merging it would **make things worse** (this should rarely be the case when contributing to the handbook, for example). Most merge requests that are in progress don't make things worse. In this case, do not use WIP; if someone merges it earlier than you expected just create a new merge request for additional items. Never ask someone to do a final review or merge something that still has WIP status.
17. If any follow-up actions are required on the issue after the pull request is merged (like reporting back to any customers or writing documentation), avoid auto-closing the issue.
18. If a project requires multiple approvals to accept your PR, feel free to assign multiple reviewers concurrently. This way the earliest available reviewer can start right away rather than being blocked by the preceding reviewer.

## Issues

Issues are useful when there isn't a specific code change that is being proposed or needed. For example, you may want to start an issue for tracking progress or for project management purposes that do not pertain to code commits. This can be particularly useful when tracking team tasks and creating issue boards. However it is still important to maintain focus when opening issues by defining a single specific topic of discussion as well as defining the desired outcome that would result in the resolution of the issue. The point is to not keep issues open-ended and to prevent issues from going stale due to lack of resolution. For example, a team member may open an issue to track the progress of a presentation with associated to-do items that need to be completed by a certain date (e.g. first draft, recording, publish). Once the specific items are completed, the issue can successfully be closed. Below are a few things to remember when creating issues:

1. When **closing** an issue leave a comment explaining why you are closing the issue and what the MVC outcome was of the discussion (if it was implemented or not).
1. We keep our **promises** and do not make external promises without internal agreement.
1. Be proactive and consistent with communication on discussions that have external stakeholders such as customers. It's important to keep communication flowing to keep everyone up to date. Issues can appear stale if there aren't recent discussions and no clear definition on when another update will be provided, based on feedback. This leaves those subscribed in the dark, causing unnecessary surprise if something ends up delayed and suddenly jumps to the next milestone. It is important that issues are closed in a timely manner. One way of doing this is having the current assignee set a due date for when they will provide another update. This can be days or weeks ahead depending on the situation, prioritization, and available capacity that we may have.
2. **Cross link** issues or MRs with related conversations. Another example is to add "Report: " lines to the issue description with links to relevant issues and feature requests. When done, add a comment to relevant issues (and close them if you are responsible for reporting back, or reassign if you are not). This prevents internal confusion and us failing to report back to the reporters.
3. When cross-linking issues or PRs, include a preview of the content you are linking, to facilitate low-context communication:
   1. Good: `this would cause performance issue similar to #123456`. The reader has full information on first read and can refer to the link for more.
   2. Avoid: `this would cause issue similar to #123456`. The reader needs to click the link and find the relevant information among other discussion threads, before switching back to the original discussion.
4. When providing links to specific lines of code relevant to the issue, **always use a permalink** (a link to a specific commit for the file). This ensures that the reference is still valid if the file changes. For more information, see [Link to specific lines of code](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/working-with-advanced-formatting/creating-a-permanent-link-to-a-code-snippet).
5. Assign an issue to yourself as soon as you start to work on it, but not before that time. If you complete part of an issue and need someone else to take the next step, **re-assign** the issue to that person.
6. Ensure the issue **title** states what the desired outcome should be. For instance, for bugs make sure the issue states the desired result, not the current behavior.
7.  **Regularly update** the issue description with the latest information and its current status, especially when important decisions were made during the discussion. The issue description should be the **single source of truth**.
8.  If you want someone to review an issue, do not assign them to it. Instead, @-mention them in an issue comment. Being assigned to an issue is a signal that the assignee should or intends to work on it. So you should not assign someone to an issue and mis-represent this with a false signal.
9.  If you'd like to inform someone about an issue, or assign a task to them - do so via an issue comment not just adding them to the description. Here's why - the To Do generated when mentioning someone in an issue description provides little context to the action requested, explicitly informing them of the action via a comment ensures when they read the To Do they have more context without reading the entire issue.
10. Do not close an issue until it is [**done**](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/contributing/merge_request_workflow.html#definition-of-done). It's okay to explicitly ask if everyone is on board and in agreement on how to move forward, whether to iterate, close the open issue, or create a subsequent PR to implement a MVC.
11. Once a feature is [**done**](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/contributing/merge_request_workflow.html#definition-of-done), update the description to add a link to the corresponding documentation. When using a Search Engine, issues often appear before documentation pages, which makes it harder to find the relevant information about the feature.
12. Write issues so that they exclude private information. This way, the issue can be public. Only use confidential issues, if the issue must contain [non-public information](#not-public). **Note:** Confidential issues are [accessible to all members of the project with Reporter access and above](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/issues/confidential_issues.html#permissions-and-access-to-confidential-issues). You may consider using a Google Doc for items that require a stricter level of confidentiality.
13. If the content within a public issue transitions to become what is deemed confidential [non-public information](#not-public), the issue may be made confidential.
14. If the content of a public issue draws comments that are deemed in violation of our [code of conduct](/community/contribute/code-of-conduct/) the issue may be locked and may [undergo moderation](/handbook/marketing/community-relations/community-operations/workflows/code-of-conduct-enforcement/#overview).

## Asynchronous communication

In an [all-remote setting](/company/culture/all-remote/terminology/), mastering asynchronous workflows is vital to avoiding [dysfunction](values.md#five-dysfunctions) and enjoying outsized efficiencies and lifestyle flexibility. Asynchronous communication is the art of communicating and moving projects forward _without_ the need for additional stakeholders to be available at the same time your communique is sent.

## Top tips and best practices

1. All written communication happens in English, even when sent one on one, because sometimes you need to forward an email or chat.
1. Use **asynchronous communication** when possible: pull requests (preferred) or issues. Announcements happen on the appropriate Slack channels and [people should be able to do their work without getting interrupted by chat](https://m.signalvnoise.com/is-group-chat-making-you-sweat-744659addf7d#.21t7089jk).
1. Discussion in issues or Pull Requests is preferred over everything else. If you need a response urgently, you can Slack someone with a link to your comment on an issue or merge request, asking them to respond there, however be aware that they still may not see it straight away. See [Slack](/handbook/communication#slack) for more.
2. If you choose to email instead of chat it is OK to send an email that contains only a short message, similar as you would use in chat.
3. You are not expected to be available all the time. There is no expectation to respond to messages outside of your planned working hours.
4. Sometimes synchronous communication is the better option, but do not default to it. For example, a video call can clear things up quickly when you are blocked. See the [guidelines on video chats](#video-calls) for more detail.
5. It is very OK to ask as many questions as you have. Please ask them so many people can answer them and many people see the answer. Use issues or public chat channels instead of direct messages or one-on-one emails. If you have researched in the handbook and could not find the answer or need clarity, include the handbook link you were reviewing and state "while looking in the handbook I could not find x,y,z".
6. If you send a handbook link to someone as an answer to a question, consider adding some context, espeically if they are new to GitLab. It's great that we often have the answer documented, but it's not always easy to find if you are a new team member. 
7. If the answer to a question isn't documented, please immediately make a pull request to add it to the handbook in a place you have looked for it. It is great for the person who answered the question to see you leading by example to ensure that question only needs to be answered once. A pull request is the best way to say thanks for help.
8. If you mention something (a pull request, issue, commit, webpage, comment, etc.) please include a link to it.
9. All company data should be **shareable** by default. Do not use a local text file, but rather leave comments on an issue.
10. When someone asks something, give back a deadline or that you did it. Answers like: 'will do', 'OK', 'it is on my todo list' are not helpful. If it is small it's better to spend 2 minutes and do the tasks so the other person can mentally forget about it. If it is large you need to figure out when you'll do it, by returning that information the other person might decide to solve it in another way if it takes too long.
11. It is OK to bring an issue to someone's attention with a CC ("cc @user"), but CCs alone are not enough if specific action is needed from someone. The mentioned user may read the issue and take no further action. If you need something, please explicitly communicate your need along with @ mentioning who you need it from.
12. Avoid creating private groups for internal discussions:
   1. It's disturbing (all users in the group get notified for each message).
   2. It's not searchable.
   3. It's not shareable: there is no way to add people in the group (and this often leads to multiple groups creation).
   4. They don't have a subject, so everyone has to remember the topic of each private group based on the participants, or open the group again to read the content.
   5. History is lost when leaving the group
13. It is perfectly fine to create a channel, even for a single meeting.
14. Use [low-context communications](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-context_and_low-context_cultures) by being explicit in your communications. We are a remote-only company, located all over the world. Provide as much context as possible to avoid confusion. Relatedly, we use [ubiquitous language](#ubiquitous-language) for communication efficiency.
15. When discussing concepts, be careful not to lean too much into hypotheticals. There is a tipping point in which it decreases value and no longer becomes constructive at helping everyone come into a unified decision.
16. Consult our [tips for better writing](/company/culture/all-remote/effective-communication/#tips-for-better-writing).


### Smart note-taking in meetings

Note taking helps us to work with people asynchronously as team members can add their thoughts to an agenda in advance of a meeting and understand what was discussed if they cannot attend. It also offers a record of what was discussed that can later be referenced. While it may not be feasible to capture all words said in a meeting, focus on noting speakers and their key points. Extensive note-taking should not happen at the expense of correct note-taking. At the end of the meeting, try to clearly capture key takeaways, next steps, and [DRIs](/handbook/people-group/directly-responsible-individuals/#what-is-a-directly-responsible-individual).

While a designated person may be the primary person responsible for note-taking in a specific meeting, all team members should feel empowered to chip in. Note-taking can be a lot for a single person to stay on top of--especially when there is a fast moving conversation with many speakers. Team members can contribute by helping with notes, correcting anything that is incorrect (names, abbreviations, etc.), and adding key details that were important but missed.

### Asking "is this known"

If something is behaving strangely on the data platform, it might be a bug. It could also mean that something was changed intentionally.

[TKTK add proces here]


### Multimodal communication

Employ multimodal communication to broadcast important decisions. To reach our distributed organization, announce important decisions in the company announcements Slack channel, email the appropriate team email lists, Slack the appropriate channels, and target 1:1s or other important meetings on the same day, with the same information.

When doing this, create and link to a [single source of truth](/company/culture/all-remote/handbook-first-documentation/): ideally the [handbook](/handbook/handbook-usage/#why-handbook-first), otherwise an epic, issue, or Google Doc. The email or Slack message should not be the source of truth.

When referring to email that recipients should have received, reference the sender and subject of the email so it's easy to find. For example, "You should have received an email from Jane Smith with the subject 'Training Seminar Details'".

## Effective communication competency

In an all-remote organization effective communication is key to exchanging knowledge, ideas, and information. Effective communication on the DE team:

- Uses [asynchronous](/company/culture/all-remote/asynchronous/) communication as the starting point and stays as open and transparent as we can by [communicating via text](#writing-style-guidelines) through public issues, merge requests, and Slack channels (not DMs).
- Places an emphasis on ensuring that conclusions of offline conversations are written down ensuring a [Single Source of Truth](/handbook/documentation/#documentation-is-the-single-source-of-truth-ssot).
- Produces video when necessary.


**Skills and behavior of applying effective communication as a Team Member**:

- Effectively practices communication via text.
- Uses asynchronous communication when possible: merge requests (preferred) or issues.
- Directs all communication to the appropriate channels (Slack, GitLab, email).
- Recognises when synchronous communication is the more appropriate option.
- Directs all decisions and discussions to the Handbook as a single source of truth.
- Records videos to communicate information when that is the most efficient and effective way to consume the content.
- Employs multimodal communication to broadcast important decisions.
- Practices low context communication and provides as much background as possible when communicating via text to avoid confusion.

**Skills and behavior of applying effective communication as a People Manager**:

- Implements working asynchronously across teams, departments or across the company. Drives communication where possible to asynchronous channels.
- Holds team members accountable for effectively communicating via text.
- Fosters an environment across teams, departments or divisions where asynchronous communication is the starting point.
- Guides team members on when producing video is appropriate. Implements interactive communication tools across their team, department or the company depending on level.
- Drives and funnels conversations to the right channels across teams, divisions and the company.

## Numbering is for reference, not as a signal

When taking notes in an agenda, in the handbook, or on our [OKRs](/company/okrs/), keep items numbered so we can refer to Item 3 or 4a.
The number is not a signal of the importance or rank of the subject unless explicitly stated to be such.
It is just for ease of reference.

## Cross link

Linking should not be in one direction. We should go beyond deep-linking to create a richer web of links that can surface content and ensure people consider all pages when making updates. When linking one page to another, try to link back as well. Instead of only linking from Page A to Page B, both link Page A to Page B and link Page B back to Page A. 

## Acknowledgement Receipts

In informal acknowledgement scenarios, such as on Slack or on issue comments, it is common practice to use the following to signal acknowledgement:

- Eyes 👀 => I’ll check this out or seen and will do
- Thumbs up 👍 => good idea
- White checkmark ✅ => task is complete or done
- Heart ❤ ️= expression of gratitude or appreciation
- cc @mentions => if someone needs to see a message

## Presentations

1. All presentations are made in Google Slides using our templates [TKTK link to templates].
2. Please allow anyone at the Inquirer to edit the presentation (preferred) or at least comment on the presentation.
3. The title of every slide should be the message you want the audience to take away, not the subject matter. So use 'Our revenue more than doubled' instead of 'Revenue growth'.
4. During introductions, make sure that nobody is presenting. We remember people better and have more empathy when we clearly see peoples faces and expressions.
5. At the end of the presentation, when you go to Q&A, stop presenting in Zoom/Google Meet. This way the other people can see the person who is speaking much better.
6. All presentations on the DE team should be based on screenshots of the handbook, issues, and merge requests. In most cases it shouldn't be needed to make content uniquely for the presentation. If you need something that doesn't exist yet add it to the place it belongs and then copy it into the presentation. This way we can have a [Single Source of Truth](/company/culture/all-remote/handbook-first-documentation/#creating-a-home-for-a-single-source-of-truth-ssot) for everything we do. By using screenshots you indicate to people you did the right thing and they can find the canonical source in the appropriate place. Having to find information by digging through old presentations doesn't scale. Consider linking the screenshot to the original source.
7. Do not use cumulative graphs internally. For example total ARR, total user, total contributors, or total Merge Requests. Instead use IACV per dollar spend, users added per month, contributions per month, or [MR rate](/handbook/engineering/development/performance-indicators/#development-department-member-mr-rate). Cumulative graphs can [hide trends](https://heap.io/blog/data-stories/how-to-lie-with-data-visualization) and are [far more likely to be misinterpreted](https://measuringu.com/cumulative-graphs/). The only acceptable use of cumulative graphs is for external presentations where they are expected by the audience and commonly used.
8. When your presentation includes graphs or other data, make sure your graphs have clear titles and dimensions. Make sure your data has significant figures and labels. For example, use 'January: 1.95M projects' instead of 'January: 1.95M'. Keep in mind that your audience may not have the full context, especially if they are reading the presentation asynchronously.
9.  When giving a presentation, your commentary should not be a regurgitation of the words in the slide. The audience can read the slide for themselves; your commentary should focus on the most important takeaways.

### Video and presentation tips with Lorraine Lee

On 2022-01-20, GitLab's L&D team hosted [Lorraine Lee](https://linkedin.com/in/lorraineklee) for a live speaker series on video and presentation techniques in an all-remote workspace. 

Key points addressed in the training include:

- **Increase your confidence on video** using lighting, visuals, and curating your environment
- **Keep your audience engaged** with movement, power words, and the think/do/feel matrix
- **Stay connected with your audience** by smiling, making eye contact, and framing yourself in video
- **Insert energy** by standing up, projecting, and using hand gestures

## Say thanks

As we continue to build on [inclusion](values.md#diversity-inclusion), recognition is a key and transformative tactic. Thanking team members provides an opportunity for them to be recognized for their contributions, influences engagement behavior, and acknowledges to team members their work is seen. By saying thanks, you are contributing to and supporting the value of [DIB](values.md#diversity-inclusion).

1. Thank people that did a great job in our `#data-insights` Slack channel. Almost everyone in the company is active in this channel so please don't be shy.
2. Consider other channels where recognition can be acknowledged: team meetings, issues, company calls, 1-1 meetings, etc.
3. If someone is a team member just `@`-mention them, if multiple people were working on something try `@`-mentioning each person.
4. When announcing a completed project, list the key contributors.
5. Please be as timely as possible with your recognition.
6. If possible please include a link with your thanks that points to the subject matter that you are giving thanks for, for example a link to a merge request.
7. Please do not mention working outside of working hours, we want to minimize the pressure to do so.
8. Please do not celebrate Inquirer contribution graphs that include working for uninterrupted weeklong cycles, as this does not foster healthy [work/life harmony](/company/culture/all-remote/people/#worklife-harmony) for all team members. While DE team members are free to time-shift and work weekends in place of weekdays, we discourage celebrating the absence of time away from work.
9. Do not thank the CEO or other executives for something that the company paid for, thank GitLab instead.
10. To thank someone who is not a team member, you can [nominate them for community swag](/handbook/marketing/community-relations/code-contributor-program/community-appreciation/).
11. Understand that everyone doesn't need or want recognition. Once this is advised, please respect when they don't.


## Communicate directly

When working on a problem or issue, communicate directly with the people you need support from rather than working through reporting lines. Direct communication with the people you need to collaborate with is more efficient than working through your manager, their manager, or another intermediary.
Escalate to management if you are not getting the support you need. Remember that everyone is a [manager of one](values.md#managers-of-one) and they might have to complete their own assignments and inform the reporting lines.

## Effective Listening

It is estimated that listeners will filter out or change the intended meaning of what is heard in 70% of all communications. [Source](https://1personalcareercoach.com/art-listening-good-leader).

**Myths about Listening**

- Everybody knows how to listen.
- Sending messages is more important than receiving them.
- Listening is easy and passive.
- Hearing and listening are the same thing.
- An effective speaker commands audience attention.
- Communication is the sender’s responsibility.
- Listening is done with our ears.
- Listening skills are practiced and not learned.
- Listening ability comes from maturity.

**Tips for Effective Listening**

- Concentrate.
- Give unequivocal attention to the speaker.
- Don’t anticipate what the speaker means.
- Test the message not the messenger.
- Respect cultural difference and boundaries.
- Develop the fine art of empathy.
- Try not to interrupt.
- Focus on feelings and not grammar or vocabulary.
- Silence is the golden rule.

**Being Assertive**

There is a delicate balance between being confident enough to be assertive of personal rights and boundaries while respectful of others.

- Know the distinction between being assertive and being aggressive or arrogant.
- Establish clear boundaries when dealing with others.
- Politely but directly let people know your position.
- Know what you want.
- Avoid being timid.
- Be willing to clearly say either yes or no and stand by your answer.
- Avoid arrogance.
- When opinions are in question give yourself permission to disclose yours.

## Inquirer Sits

- Inquirer Sits is a short time for Inquirer team members to spend time together in a guided meditation of centering and refocusing. There is [evidence that meditating together has additional benefits over meditating alone](https://www.mindful.org/benefit-meditating-alone-together/).
- The call takes place Monday through Friday 12:00pm-12:25pm ET. The first 20 minutes are dedicated to medidation, and the final five minutes are dedicated to discussion. 
- You're welcome to join the call on whichever days work for you.
- No previous experience is necessary, nothing extra is needed other than a comfortable seat and 25 minutes.
- If you're interested in joining Inquirer Sits, you can ask for a calendar invite in the #inquirer-sits Slack channel.


## Sprint retrospectives and kickoffs

## Scheduling meetings

1. If you want to ask Inquirer team members if they are available for an event please send a calendar invite with Google Calendar using your Google Inquirer account to their Google Inquirer account. When you add a Inquirer team member as a “Guest” in Google Calendar, you can click the See Guest Availability button to check availability and find a time on their calendar. These calendar invites will automatically show up on all parties calendars even when the email is not opened. It is an easier way to ensure everyone has visibility to the meeting and member’s status. Please respond quickly to invites so people can make necessary plans.
2. Every scheduled meeting should have an accompanying Google Doc that is prepopulated with an agenda, as well as meeting notes submitted before, during, and after the meeting.
   - If a Google Doc has not already been created for the meeting, you can create one by clicking on [Take meeting notes](https://workspaceupdates.googleblog.com/2021/10/create-meeting-notes-in-google-calendar.html) in the Google Calendar event.
      - If you create a meeting notes document using this flow, move it to the [Meeting Notes folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1A8uu317RQOyJ9m77pJm4CEsC9ROPl8BO?usp=sharing) on the [Data & Insights shared drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/0AIZYO4MJ2UV7Uk9PVA?ths=true)
      - When sharing links to meeting notes on Slack, the googledrive Slack app will prompt you if some people in the channel do not have access to the file. Select "Allow everyone to comment and edit" from the dropdown menu so that everyone in the channel can contribute.
   - A suggested format for 1:1 agendas can be found on the [1:1 leadership page](/handbook/leadership/1-1/).
3. If you want to check if a team member is available for an outside meeting, create a calendar appointment and invite the team member only after they respond yes. Then invite outside people.
4. When scheduling a call with multiple people, invite them using a Google Calendar that is your own, or one specific to the people joining, so the calendar item doesn't unnecessarily appear on other people's calendars.
5. If you want to move a meeting just move the calendar appointment instead of reaching out via other channels. Note the change at the top of the description.
6. Please click 'Guests can modify event' so people can update the time in the calendar instead of having to reach out via other channels. You can configure this to be checked by default under [Event Settings](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/r/settings).)
7. When scheduling a meeting we value people's time and prefer the "speedy meetings" [setting in our Google Calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/r/settings). This gives us meetings of, for example, 25 or 50 minutes leaving some time to:
   - Write notes and reflect
   - Respond to urgent messages
   - Take a [bio break](https://www.merriam-webster.com/words-at-play/bio-break-meaning-and-origin)
   - Stretch your legs
   - Grab a snack
8. When scheduling a meeting, please try to have it start at :00 (hour) or :30 (mid-hour) to leave common start times available for other meetings on your attendees' calendars. Meetings should be for the time needed, so if you need 15 minutes just book that.
9.  When creating a calendar event that will be used company wide, [please place it on the GitLab Team Meetings Calendar](/handbook/tools-and-tips/#gitlab-team-meetings-calendar). That way the event is easily located by all individuals.
10. When you need to cancel a meeting, make sure to delete/decline the meeting and choose the option **Delete & update guests** to make sure everyone knows you can't attend and don't wait for you.
11. If you want to schedule a meeting with a person not on the team please use [Calendly](/handbook/tools-and-tips/other-apps/#calendly). Use Google Calendar directly if scheduling with a GitLab team member.
12. **Materials Review** are scheduled as all day not busy events as a reminder three days before the scheduled call.

### Focus Fridays

The goal of Focus Fridays is to maximize efficiency by creating designated meeting-free space within our weeks for focused work, which also aligns with our push to [operate asynchronously](/company/culture/all-remote/asynchronous/). Other benefits include reducing potential burnout, and being more thoughtful both in and about the meetings on the other days of the week. Guidance for Focus Fridays includes:

- Cancel or move any standing meetings occurring on Fridays.
- Urgent and important one-off internal meetings might not be avoidable, but we should aim to minimize them as much as possible and defer to async work where we can.
- Consider blocking off your calendar as "busy" on Fridays to block your work time.
- Consider looking into apps like [Reclaim](https://app.reclaim.ai) that can help defend your calendar
- Consider using Fridays to dedicate time to your learning and development.

You are encouraged to talk to your manager for guidance on how best to embrace Focus Fridays on your team and with your individual schedule. Managers are encouraged to provide coaching and guidance.

### Meeting Cleanup Day

On February 14, or the Tuesday after if this day falls over the weekend or on Monday, we have an annual calendar cleanup day. This is a day when all team members are encouraged to look at their calendars and reassess the value and frequency of recurring meetings. The goals are to increase team member [efficiency](values.md#efficiency) as team members stop attending low value meetings and reassess how to make continuing meetings more productive. Team members should be empowered to:

- Cancel meetings or change the frequency if they feel that the current cadence does not add sufficient value
- Remove themselves as meeting attendees if they don't feel that they are contributing or that participation supports business results
- Ask other team members to reexamine how existing meetings are managed

When cancelling a meeting, a team member can copy and paste this message to send to attendees:
_I evaluated the need for this meeting as part of [Meeting Cleanup Day](#meeting-cleanup-day). I have determined that the meeting is no longer needed. Please get in touch if you have any concerns._

When changing the cadence of a meeting, a team member can copy and paste this message to send to attendees:

_I reassessed this meeting as part of [Meeting Cleanup Day](#meeting-cleanup-day). I have determined that the meeting no longer needs to happen as frequently. Please look for an updated meeting invite and get in touch if you have any concerns._

If you are a team member who intends to decline a meeting, the [asynchronous communication](/company/culture/all-remote/asynchronous/#how-to-decline-meetings-in-favor-of-async) section of the handbook has some good suggestions for what to say when you decline.

Meeting Cleanup Day is intentionally a few weeks after the start of the new fiscal year.

### Common meeting problems

Meetings are incredibly expensive since they require synchronous time.
The most common meeting problems can all be addressed by following the above guidelines around scheduling meetings.
Some of the most common meetings problems are outlined below:

| Problem                                                                             | Solution                                                                                                 |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Present instead of Q&A                                                              | Pre-record presentations on YouTube, so meetings are only Q&A                                            |
| Meetings set up for or default to brainstorming                                     | People should default to making thoughtful proposals async and building upon them in meetings, if needed |
| No agenda with edit rights for everyone                                             | Ensure that every meeting has an agenda and is available for everyone to edit                            |
| People are late to meetings or don't have time to use the restroom between meetings | Use Speedy Meetings to give people breathing space before their next meeting                             |

### No presenting in meetings

If you are hosting a meeting, it's okay not to have a presentation or have a pre-recorded presentation. What's not okay is [doing the presentation](#common-meeting-problems) during the session because you are taking valuable synchronous time away from the attendees, which could be asynchronous. It is easier to watch a recording in more locations than joining a Zoom call. A recording makes content more accessible, prevents confusion, and increases participation for team members that prefer consuming content [asynchronously](values.md#bias-towards-asynchronous-communication). Meetings take up valuable time and resources for the company. They are expensive since they require synchronous time.

Make a pre-recorded video presentation using mmhmm (TKTK find training materials), and attach it to the meeting agenda. At least 24 hours in advance of the meeting, announce in Slack Channels that the meeting has a pre-recorded video, and all attendees are advised to watch beforehand. Use the meeting time for Q&A versus presenting information to the audience with slides.

**Pre-recorded presentations enable the following:**

- Pre-recording the presentation allows the time to be used for back and forth Q&A (as seen in [Group Conversations](/handbook/group-conversations/#presentation), which enables meeting attendees to have their questions answered on the topic without running out of time.
- Reinforces GitLab's [Bias Towards Asynchronous Communication](values.md#bias-towards-asynchronous-communication) because it helps team members in different timezones to consume the presentation material async versus spending time in a meeting.
- Strengthens [self-service and self-learning](values.md#self-service-and-self-learning) by maximizing the meeting time's efficiency to ensure that team members have their voices heard during the Q&A.
- Standardizes the approach to meetings across the organization.
- Pre-recorded meetings have transcripts that can boost content value, help team members focus, and increase accessibility.
- Recordings can be sped up and rewound by team members watching on their own time.
- Encourages and enables greater participation from [neurodiverse team members](values.md#embracing-neurodiversity) who might take added time to process the presentation and reflect on their questions before asking them.
- Allows for selective watching of presentation material for a certain period.

There are times when presenting during a meeting is needed. This may occur when adding more context to a specific topic on slides. If this is the case, consider the following:

- A presentation, with optional attendance and mandatory recording. This will allow clarifying questions to be asked and answered efficently and enables team members to watch async.
- Include an async Q&A doc for team members who did not attend the presentation.
- Ensure the async Q&A doc is linked in the YouTube description.

## Indicating availability

Indicate your availability by updating your own calendar using Google's ["out of office"](https://www.theverge.com/2018/6/27/17510656/google-calendar-out-of-office-option) feature and include the dates you plan to be away in your automated response. Note that this feature will automatically decline any meeting invitations during the time frame you select.

1. Put your planned away time including holidays, vacation, travel time, and other leave in your own calendar. 
2. Set your working hours in your Google Calendar settings.


## Video calls

1. Use video calls if you find yourself going back and forth in an issue/via email
   or over chat. Guideline: if you have gone **back and forth 3 times**, it's time
   for a video call.
1. Sometimes it's better to _not_ have a video call. Consider these tradeoffs:
   - It is difficult (or impossible) to multi-task in a video call.
   - It may be more efficient to have an async conversation in an issue, depending on the topic.
   - A video call is limited in time: A conversation in an issue can start or stop at any time, whenever there's interest. It is async.
   - A video call is limited in people: You can invite anybody into an async conversation at any time in an issue. You don't have to know who the relevant parties are ahead of time. Everyone can contribute at any time. A video call is limited to invited attendees (and those who have accepted).
   - You can easily "promote" an async conversation from an issue to a video call, as needed. The reverse is harder. So there is lower risk to start with an async conversation.
   - For a newcomer to the conversation, it's easier and more efficient to parse an issue, than read a video transcript or watch it.
   - Conversations in issues are easily searchable. Video calls are not.
1. Try to have your video on at all times because it's much more engaging for participants.
   - Do not worry if you [can't pay attention at the meeting](#paying-attention-in-meetings) because you're doing something else, you are the manager of your attention. The flip-side of being the manager of your own attention is that others should not hesitate to request your attention when it is needed.
   - During internal calls, it's okay to eat on video if you're hungry or the call is during your lunch time (please turn your mic off).
   - You should ensure that you are properly dressed for all video calls. Properly dressed means that you are wearing clothing that covers the top and bottom parts of your body. We do not have a strict dress code policy, but want to make sure that all participants on video calls feel comfortable. If you cannot be properly dressed for the entirety of the call, you should not join, but watch a recording at a later time.
   - Having pets, children, significant others, friends, and family visible during video chats is encouraged. 
   - Do not feel forced to have your video on, use your best judgement.
2. We prefer [TKTK - Zoom? Meet?]
3. [Hybrid calls are annoying](#hybrid-calls-are-annoying).
4. Always be sure to advise participants to mute their mics if there is unnecessary background noise to ensure the speaker is able to be heard by all attendees.
5. We start on time and do not wait for people. People are expected to join no later than the scheduled minute of the meeting (before :01 if it is scheduled for :00). The question 'is everyone here' is not needed.
6.  It feels rude in video calls to interrupt people. This is because the latency causes you to talk over the speaker for longer than during an in-person meeting. We should not be discouraged by this, the questions and context provided by interruptions are valuable.
   This is a situation where we have to do something counter intuitive to make all-remote meetings work. On the DE team, everyone is encouraged to interrupt the speaker in a video call to ask a question or offer context. We want everyone to contribute instead of a monologue.
   Just like in-person meetings be cognizant of when, who, and how you interrupt, we don't want [manterrupting](http://time.com/3666135/sheryl-sandberg-talking-while-female-manterruptions/).
11. We end on the scheduled time. It might feel rude to end a meeting, but you're actually allowing all attendees to be on time for their next meeting.
12. Do not use the chat of products like Zoom or Google Meet to communicate during the call, use the linked document instead. This allows everyone to contribute additional questions, answers, and links in the relevant place. It also makes it easier for people in conflicting timezones to contribute questions before the call and makes it easier to review questions and answers after the call.
13. You do not need to remind other people to vocalize their questions. Just say their name and a keyword of the question, e.g. 'Jay about credit-cards'.
14. Every comment is document worthy, even small support comments such as `+1` or `Very Cool!`.
15. We encourage the recording and [sharing of everything to our YouTube Unfiltered channel](/handbook/marketing/marketing-operations/youtube/).
16. It is unusual to smoke in an open office or video conference, vaping is associated with this. For this reason we ask that you don't vape during calls, and if you absolutely have to, kindly switch your camera off.
17. Speak up when you notice something is not working. If you notice someone's microphone, web cam or latency is causing issues for them it is good to speak up. On a video call it can be harder for the speaker to notice that they aren't being understood compared to a face to face conversation. As such you will be doing them a favour by speaking up early to let them know that they are having a problem. Also see [Hear nothing say something](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZ5spXU5HbU) for further explanation.


### Note taking

- [Write down your questions](values.md#write-things-down) in the agenda before vocalizing. Always ask people to vocalize their questions to provide the most detailed context and for any people that only use audio, for example listening to a recording of the call later while running.
- If there isn’t a note taker listed in the document at the start of the meeting, people should self-note-take. If you're not talking in the meeting, at any given time, help take notes.
- Consider asking other people to write down the answers in real-time to allow the person who asked the question to focus on the answer. The person asking the question can touch up the answer when the conversation has moved on to something less relevant to them.

### You are the manager of your attention

You are the manager of your attention, and you decide when you do or don't pay attention in a meeting.

You will always have more work than time in your life.
If you get invited to a meeting you don't think you should go to, you should decline the meeting.
It is better to cancel than to show up and not pay attention.

On the other hand, not every part of a meeting is relevant, but it can sometimes be helpful to have more people in a call.
If you only have one discussion point, if possible, try to reorder the meeting agenda to have your point first and then drop from the call.
If you get asked a question when you're not paying attention, it is an okay use of time to repeat a question every now and then.
If training is required for one's role, team members should plan to give the training full attention--especially if engagement in discussions or breakout rooms is required. If training is 'nice to learn' or 'optional' for team members, multi-tasking can be done at the team members discretion.


We don't use the first 15 minutes of a meeting to read the materials like they [do at Amazon](https://www.forbes.com/sites/carminegallo/2019/06/18/how-the-first-15-minutes-of-amazons-leadership-meetings-sparks-great-ideas-and-better-conversations/#6be165bd54ca). You can use the start of a meeting to review the materials for the meeting if you need to, given you do not have to be paying attention, but that should not delay the start of the meeting for the people that already have questions based on the materials. [Meetings start on time on the DE team.](#scheduling-meetings)

### Do not ask meeting attendees to pay attention

There are too few hours in a week, so we expect each team member to [manage their attention](#you-are-the-manager-of-your-attention). If you're hosting a meeting, don't tell people to give you their attention or stop multi-tasking. Respect each team member's agency over their time. Instead of demanding attention, earn participants' attention by organizing and facilitating meetings so they are compelling to attendees.

### First post is a badge of honor

You should take pride in being the first person to add a question to a
meeting agenda, however unlike [the First post](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/first)
meme we do want the first post to be
more than just "First!". The meeting DRI will be happy to see there is a
question ready before to kick off the meeting. The Meeting DRI should remember
to thank the person for asking the first question.

### Do not do a countdown before ending a call

Never do a countdown or say something like. "I'll give it x seconds", people are very unlikely to ask a question if you do that. Either ask for a question, wait for a question, or end the call.

## Hybrid calls are annoying

In calls that have remote participants everyone should use their own equipment (camera, headset, screen).

When multiple people share equipment the following **problems arise for remote participants**:

- Can't hear the sharing people well
- Background noise since the microphone of the sharing people is on all the time
- Can't clearly see facial expressions since each face takes up only a small part of the screen
- Can't easily see who is talking since the screen shows multiple people
- Hard getting a word in since their delay is longer than for the sharing people

The **people sharing equipment also have problems** because they don't have their own equipment:

- Can't easily screen share something themselves
- Trouble seeing details in screen sharing since the screen is further away from them
- Can't scroll through a slide deck at their own pace
- Sharing people can't easily participate (view or type) in a shared document with the agenda and meeting notes.

The disadvantages for remote people are much greater than for the sharing people and hard to notice for the sharing people.
The disadvantages cause previously remote participants to travel to the meeting to be in person for a better experience.
The extra travel is inefficient since it is time consuming, expensive, bad for the environment, and unhealthy.

Theoretically you can have multiple people in a room with their own equipment but in practice it is much better to be in separate rooms:

- It is annoying to first hear someone talk in the room and then hear it over audio with a delay.
- It is hard to consistently mute yourself when not talking to prevent someone else's voice coming through your microphone as well.

## User communication guidelines

- Keep conversations positive, friendly, real, and productive while adding value.
- If you make a mistake, admit it. Be upfront and be quick with your correction. If you're posting to a blog, you may choose to modify an earlier post. Just make it clear that you have done so.
- There can be a fine line between healthy debate and incendiary reaction. Try to frame what you write to invite differing points of view without inflaming others. You don’t need to respond to every criticism or barb. Be careful and considerate.
- [Assume positive intent](values.md#assume-positive-intent) and explicitly state the strongest plausible interpretation of what someone says before you respond, not a weaker one that's easier to criticize. [Rapoport's Rules](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Rapoport%27s_Rules) also implores you to list points of agreement and mention anything you learned.
- Answer questions, thank people even if it’s just a few words. Make it a two way conversation.
- Appreciate suggestions and feedback.
- Do not make promises that you can't keep.
- Guide users who ask for help or give a suggestion and share links. [Improving Open Development for Everyone](/blog/2015/12/16/improving-open-development-for-everyone/), [Types of requests](/blog/2014/12/08/explaining-gitlab-bugs/).
- When facing negative comments, respond patiently and treat every user as an individual, people with the strongest opinions can turn into the strongest supporters.
- Adhere to the Code of Conduct (TKTK find link) in all communication. No one should accept being mistreated.

## Writing style guidelines

1. On the DE team, we use American English as the standard written language.
2. Do not use rich text, it makes it hard to copy/paste. Use Markdown to format text that is stored in a Git repository. In Google Docs use "Normal text" using the style/heading/formatting dropdown and paste without formatting.
3. Do not use ALL CAPS because it [feels like shouting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_caps#Association_with_shouting). 
4. We use Unix style (lf) line endings, not Windows style (crlf), please ensure `*.md text eol=lf` is set in the repository's `.gitattributes` and run `git config --global core.autocrlf input` on your client.
5. Always write a paragraph on a single line. Use soft breaks ("word wrap") for readability. Do not put in a hard return at a certain character limit (e.g., 80 characters) and don't set your IDE to automatically insert hard breaks. Pull requests for the blog and handbook are very difficult to edit when hard breaks are inserted.
6. Do not create links like "here" or "click here". All links should have relevant anchor text that describes what they link to, such as: "GitLab CI source installation documentation". Using [meaningful links](https://www.futurehosting.com/blog/links-should-have-meaningful-anchor-text-heres-why/) is important to both search engine crawlers (SEO) and accessibility for people with learning differences and/or physical disabilities.
   This guidance should be followed in all places links are provided, whether in the handbook, website, GoogleDocs, or any other content.
   Avoid writing GoogleDocs content which states - `Zoom Link [Link]`.
   Rather, paste the full link directly following the word `Zoom`.
   This makes the link more prominent and makes it easier to follow while viewing the document.
7. Always use [ISO dates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601#Calendar_dates) in all writing and documents since other formats lead to online confusion. Use `yyyy-mm-dd`, for example 2015-04-13, and never 04-13-2015, 13-04-2015, 2015/04/13, 20150413, 2015.04.13, nor April 13, 2015. Even if you use an unambiguous alternative format it is still harder to search for a date, sort on a date, and for other team members to know we use the ISO standard. For months use `yyyy-mm`, so 2018-01 for January. Refer to a year with CY18 (never with 2018) and a quarter with CY18-Q1 to prevent confusion with fiscal years and quarters. If the year is obvious from the context it is OK to use Dec 4, but not 12/4, since the ordering isn't obvious when using two numbers but when naming the month it is clear that the number of the day of the month.
8. Remember that not everyone is working in the same timezone; what may be morning for you is evening for someone else. Try to say 3 hours ago or 4 hours from now, or use a timestamp, including a timezone reference.
9.  We use UTC as the timezone for engineering. We use Eastern Time (ET) for all other uses since we are a San Francisco-based company. Please refer to time as `9:00 AM Eastern` or `9:00 PM ET` as well as `9:00 AM UTC` (for engineering and product related items). It isn't often necessary to specify whether a timezone is currently observing Daylight Saving Time, and such references are often incorrect, so prefer "ET" to "EDT" or "EST" unless you have a specific need to differentiate between EDT and EST. Note, we communicate time using the [12-hour clock format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/12-hour_clock). As such, make sure to include `AM` or `PM`.
10. When specifying measurements, please include both Metric and Imperial equivalents.
11. Although we're a San Francisco based company we're also an internationally diverse one. Please do not refer to team members outside the US as international, instead use non-US. Please also avoid the use of offshore/overseas to refer to non-American continents.
12. If you have multiple points in a comment or email, please number them. Numbered lists are easier to reference during a discussion over bulleted lists.
13. When you reference an issue, merge request, comment, commit, page, doc, etc. and you have the URL available please paste that in.
14. In making URLs, always prefer hyphens to underscores, and always use lowercase.
15. The community includes users, contributors, core team members, customers, people working for GitLab Inc., and friends of GitLab. If you want to refer to "people not working for GitLab Inc." just say that and don't use the word community. If you want to refer to people working for GitLab Inc. you can also use "the GitLab Inc. team" but don't use the "GitLab Inc. employees".
16. When we refer to the GitLab community excluding GitLab team members please say "wider community" instead of "community".
17. All people working for GitLab (the company) are the [GitLab team](/company/team/). We also have the [Core team](/community/core-team/) that consists of volunteers.
18. Please always refer to GitLab Inc. people as GitLab team members, not employees.
19. Use [inclusive and gender-neutral language](https://techwhirl.com/gender-neutral-technical-writing/) in all writing.
20. Always write "GitLab" with "G" and "L" capitalized, even when writing "GitLab.com", except within URLs. When "gitlab.com" is part of a URL it should be lowercase.
21. Refer to products by tier name only on Marketing pages: Our tier names are Ultimate, Premium, and Free. When both deployment models are being referred to (SaaS and self-managed), use the tier name only. When only one of the deployment models is being referred to, prefix the tier name with the deployment model. E.g., SaaS-Premium, Self-Managed-Ultimate.
22. Correct capitalization of self-managed: The term `self-managed` should not be capitalized unless it's in a title or unless you are writing the full product name ("Self-Managed-Ultimate"). If it is used at the beginning of a sentence, then the first word only is capitalized: "Self-managed".
23. Refer to environments that are installed and run by the end-user as "self-managed."
24. Write a [group](/handbook/product/categories/#hierarchy) name as ["Stage:Group"](/handbook/product/categories/#naming) when you want to include the stage name for extra context.
25. Do not use a hyphen when writing the term "open source" except where doing so eliminates ambiguity or clumsiness.
26. Monetary amounts shouldn't have one digit, so prefer $19.90 to $19.9.
27. If an email needs a response, write the answer at the top of it.
28. Use the future version of words, just like we don't write internet with a capital letter anymore. We write frontend and webhook without a hyphen or space.
29. Our homepage is https://about.gitlab.com/ (with the `about.` and with `https`).
30. Try to use the [active voice](https://writing.wisc.edu/Handbook/CCS_activevoice.html) whenever possible.
31. If you use headers, properly format them (`##` in Markdown, "Heading 2" in Google Docs); start at the second header level because header level 1 is for titles. Do not end headers with a colon. Do not use emoji in headers as these cause links to have strange characters.
32. Always use a [serial comma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serial_comma) (a.k.a. an "Oxford comma") before the coordinating conjunction in a list of three, four, or more items.
33. Always use a single space between sentences rather than two.
34. Read our [Documentation Styleguide](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/styleguide/) for more information when writing documentation.
35. Do not use acronyms when you can avoid them. Acronyms have the effect of excluding people from the conversation if they are not familiar with a particular term. Example: instead of `MR`, write `merge request (MR)`.
   1. If acronyms are used, expand them at least once in the conversation or document and define them in the document using [Kramdown abbreviation syntax](https://kramdown.gettalong.org/syntax.html#abbreviations). Alternatively, link to the definition.
   2. If you don't know the meaning of an acronym, ask. It's always ok to [speak up](handbook/values/#share).
36. We segment our customers/prospects into 4 segments [Strategic, Large, Mid-Market, and Small Medium Business (SMB)](/handbook/sales/field-operations/gtm-resources/).

## Visuals

Many times an explanation can be aided by a visual.
Whenever presenting a diagram, we should still allow everyone to contribute.

## Situation-Complication-Implication-Position-Action-Benefit (SCI-PAB®)

[Mandel Communications refers to SCI-PAB®](https://www.mandel.com/why-mandel/SCI-PAB-how-to-start-a-presentation) at the "surefire, six-step method for starting any conversation or presentation." When you only have a few minutes to present your case or grab your listener's attention, this six-step process can help you communicate better and faster.

1. Situation - Expresses the current state for discussion.
1. Complication - Summarizes the critical issues, challenges, or opportunities.
1. Implication - Provides insight into the consequences that will be a result of if the Complications are not addressed.
1. Position - Notes the presenter's opinion on the necessary changes which should be made.
1. Action - Defines the expectations of the target audience/listeners.
1. Benefit - Clearly concludes how the Position and Action sections will address the Complications.
   This method can be used in presentations, emails, and everyday conversations.

Example - The Management team asking for time to resolve a problem

1. S - The failure rate last year for product X1 was an acceptable 1.5%.
1. C - Because of supply shortages in the current fiscal year we are forced to change the material of a key component.
1. I - Unfortunately, that resulted in the failure rate doubling this year.
1. P - It is critical we address this problem immediately.
1. A - Please approve the team 5 days to investigate the specific causes of the increase and establish the necessary next steps.
1. B - By doing this we will reduce the failure rate to an acceptable level and develop guidelines for preventing such problems in the future.

## Simple language

{: #simple-language}

Simple Language is meant to encourage everyone at the Inquirer to simplify the language we use.
We should always use the most clear, straightforward, and meaningful words possible in every conversation.
Avoid using "fluff" words, jargon, or "corporate-speak" phrases that don't add value.

When you **don't** use Simple Language, you:

- Confuse people and create a barrier for participants of your conversation.
- Cause others to not speak up in a meeting because they don't understand what you're saying.
- Are not inclusive of those whose first language is not English.
- Do not add value with your words.

When you **do** use Simple Language, you:

- Get work done more efficiently.
- Build credibility with your audience (your team, coworker, customer, etc.).
- Keep people's attention while you're speaking.
- Come across more confident and knowledgeable.

**Here's an example:**

_Original sentence_

> We're now launching an optimization of our approach leveraging key learnings from the project's postmortem.

_A Simple Language sentence_

> We're creating a new plan based on what we learned from this project.

Simple Language is important both when we're speaking to other team members and when we're representing the Inquirer to people outside the company.

Be sure to use Simple Language in written communications as well.
Our handbook, docs, and emails should be clear, concise, and effective.

## Email

We have a low internal email culture, as we see greater efficiency in other forms of communication (e.g. Slack). If you are emailing, please use the following guidelines:

1. Send one email per subject as multiple items in one email will cause delays (have to respond to everything) or misses (forgot one of the items).
1. Always reply to emails by replying to all, even when no action is needed. This lets the other person know that you received it. A thread is done when there is a single word reply, such as OK, thanks, or done.
1. If you're sending an email to a large group of people (or a distribution list), put those recipients in BCC (rather than in the "To" field) so that a reply all won't ping hundreds of people.
1. If you forward an email without other comments please add FYI (for your information), FYA (for your action), or FYC (for your consideration). If you forward an external request with FYC it just means the person who forwarded it will not follow up on the request and expects you to decide if you should follow up or not, the terms comes from [movie promotion to voters](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/For_Your_Consideration_(advertising)>).
2. Only Google Workspace domain admins are allowed to provision Google Groups and email distributions.
3. Emails are asynchronous, for example, if your manager emails you on a weekend it is fine to reply during the workweek.
4. If an email is or has become **urgent** feel free to ping people via chat referencing the subject of the email.
5. Where appropriate, consider using professional salutations including Hi or Hello and avoid colloquial expressions such as Hey, Oh, or Sup. Sometimes only the person's name is suitable. The level of formality should often mirror the formality from previous messages when communicating with internal team members as well as external persons.
6. Try to always use a person's name when starting or responding to a message, especially if there are multiple persons cc'd, so that the addressee knows you are addressing them.
7. Make sure all relevant letters and words that need capitalization are capitalized, such as the start of sentences or the word "I".
8. Proofread your messages so that sentences are punctuated correctly, typos are fixed, and grammar is corrected. Consider using the really helpful [Grammarly](https://app.grammarly.com/) tool - this tool is great for both native English speakers and for those who use English as an additional language.
9.  All messages and replies are signed with a professional send-off (ex. Best regards), your name, and your signature block.

## Slack

Slack is used for:

- Internal-only communication and announcements impacting all team members
- team updates
- Asynchronous team standups, questions, and quick collaboration
- Informal communication

Use a [bias for action](values.md#bias-for-action) to quickly move conversations that require collaboration and action out of Slack and into an issue.

Slack should specifically NOT be used for:

- Obtaining approvals
- Documenting decisions
- Storing official company records or documents
- Sharing personal or sensitive information regarding any individuals

Internal Slack messages between team members are still considered professional communication. Please do not use or add emoji's to Slack that are of a political, religious or of a sexual nature. You can refer to the [Religion and politics at work](values.md#religion-and-politics-at-work) section of the handbook. When in doubt do not use or add the emoji. If you have any concerns about an emoji that was used, please reach out to the author or if you are not comfortable doing so please reach out to your manager.

### Avoid direct messages

**Note:** We don't use the term _private message_, because these _direct messages_ are not inherently _private_ like a phone call or private letter. The messages are potentially accessible by Workspace admins or via Backups. Slack refers to these types of messages as [direct messages themselves](https://slack.com/intl/en-de/help/articles/212281468-What-is-a-direct-message).

When using Slack for work-related purposes, please avoid direct messages. [Direct messages discourage collaboration](http://blog.flowdock.com/2014/04/30/beware-of-private-conversations/). You might actually be contacting the wrong person, and they cannot easily redirect you to the right person. If the person is unavailable at the moment, it is less efficient because other people cannot jump in and help. Use a public channel and mention the person or group you want to reach. This ensures it is easy for other people to chime in, involve other people if needed, and learn from whatever is discussed.

If someone sends you a work-related direct message, it is okay to let them know you'd like to take the conversation to a public channel, linking to this section of the handbook. The process might look something like:

- In the direct message: `Thanks for reaching out, that's a great question/idea I think the rest of the team could benefit from. I'm going to move this to #public-channel based on [our desire to avoid direct messages](#avoid-direct-messages)`
- In the appropriate public channel: `@Person asked "question" in a DM, pulling that out here if anyone else has input.`
- Answer the question in a thread on that channel message, allowing others to benefit.

If you find yourself getting a lot of direct messages that should go in a public channel, consider changing your Slack status to an attention grabbing emoji and set it to something like:

- `Please consider posting in a public channel before direct messaging`
- `Why direct message me when you can post in a public channel?`

If you must send a work-related direct message, don't start a conversation with "Hi" or "Hey" as that interrupts their work without communicating anything. If you have a quick question, just ask the question directly, and the person will respond asynchronously. If you truly need to have a synchronous communication, then start by asking for that explicitly, while mentioning the subject. e.g., "I'm having trouble understanding issue #x, can we talk about it quickly?".

#### Do not use group direct messages

Use private channels instead of group direct messages. Group direct messages are very hard to maintain, track, and respond to. They also have a key limitation in that you can't add people to the conversation. This is a hindrance to collaboration and transparency.

Consider whether the conversation can take place in a public channel. If not, please use a private channel instead. This channel may have a short-term purpose. It is acceptable to leave the channel and/or archive it if you are no longer an active participant or the channel is no longer in use.

#### DMs

As we grow headcount, we exponentially increase the lines of communication- 3 people have 3 communication lines, 4 have 6, and 41 have 820.
As a result, there is a natural tendency for people to prefer private channels of communication.
The intentions are good, as people are looking to reduce noise for others, but this can lead to the same problems as described elsewhere on this page, notably:

- Communication is siloed.
- As we grow, people may be reaching out to the wrong person.
- If you have a question, other people might have it too.

Slack is our primary source of chat communication and is where many personal interactions happen.
We want to continue to encourage folks to build personal relationships with one another which will often happen over DMs.

We know that DMs will always exist.
We don't want to eliminate them.


### Use public channels

- If you use Slack and plan to message 3 or more people, we recommend a channel for customer/issue/project/problem/partnership.
- If something is important but not urgent - like complimenting or encouraging the entire team - use email or post in the channel without `@`-mentioning the team.
- It's not rude to leave a channel. When you've had your questions answered or are no longer interested, feel free to leave the channel so it won't distract you anymore.


### Be respectful of your own time

You should try to avoid information overload in order to be productive and efficient with your time. While it can be tempting to read every message in every Slack channel you subscribe to, it’s very challenging, not expected, and not necessary.

One method for avoiding Slack overload is to focus your Slack reading on [Starred channels](https://slack.com/intl/en-nl/help/articles/201331016-Star-channels-and-direct-messages) and [Threads](https://slack.com/help/articles/115000769927-Use-threads-to-organize-discussions-). Starred channels are like "favorites" and allow you to follow messages from those channels easily. Threads consist of any conversation in which you are mentioned and allow you to easily track conversations in which you have direct involvement.

Use your notification settings liberally. Depending on how you use Slack this could range from limiting notifications to critical messages outside of your working hours to turning off Slack notifications entirely. Find the right balance for you and stick to it.

### Be respectful of others' time

Start by understanding what we mean by respecting time. We should err toward putting material into channels over DMs and public channels over private channels even though we understand that this will generate more messages that can be read by more people. Respecting time is not about reducing the overall volume of channel messages that team members receive. It's about making sure that messages are targeted, expectations for asynchronous responses are clear, and we are communicating with consideration.

The following tips provide ways to work respectfully with others given this context:

- If you're only referring to someone, but don't actually need their attention, and want to spare them from getting notified, spell out their name normally without `@` mentioning them.
- Slack messages should be considered asynchronous communication, and you should not expect an instantaneous response; you have no idea what the other person is doing.
- Because we work globally, you may receive Slack mentions at any time of day. Please consider enabling [Slack's Do not disturb functionality](https://slack.com/intl/en-ie/help/articles/214908388-Pause-notifications-with-Do-Not-Disturb) so you don't get interrupted, for example, in your offtime. You can also use Slack's Notification schedule tool, this can be found in Slack's Preferences tab. To access this, open Slack, hover your cursor at the top of your screen, click Slack, then preferences, under the notifications tab you will see notification schedule. This tool allows you to pick what days / times you get notifications.
- Do not feel obligated to respond to Slack messages when you are not working.
- Feel free to send a colleague a link to these guidelines if the communication in Slack should be done **asynchronously**.
- **Please avoid using @here or @channel unless this is about something urgent and important.** In chat, try to keep the use of keywords that mention the whole channel to a minimum. They should only be used for pings that are both urgent and important, not just important. By overusing channel mentions, you make it harder to respond to personal mentions promptly since people get pinged too frequently. Additionally, if you are planning to `@mention` a specific team ([Slack User Group](https://get.slack.help/hc/en-us/articles/212906697-Create-a-user-group#browse-user-groups-and-view-members)), consider the size of the group you are mentioning ([see group membership](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/security-tools/report-slack-group-members)) and the impact of pinging all of these people for the particular situation. If something is urgent and important:
  - Use `@here` to notify all currently _active_ members in the room. Please only use `@here` if the message is important _and_ urgent.
  - Use `@channel` to notify _ALL_ members in the room, irrespective of away status. Please only use `@channel` if the message is important _and_ urgent.
- If you are aware that your teammate is on vacation, avoid mentioning them in a high volume channel. It will be difficult to find the information or question when they return. If you need to ensure they refer back to the thread, ensure to send them a link to the relevant Slack message through a direct message.

### Managing noise and creating focus in Slack

Slack can be a disorderly place in its default state. Consider implementing the below to add structure and focus, but remember that there will likely be more useful information shared on Slack than you are able to ingest and process on a daily basis, regardless of your approach.

While an intentional effort to organize is important, remember that [it's impossible to know everything](values.md#its-impossible-to-know-everything). As a team, we may spot information that is missed by others, and we should surface that information when pertinent as we strive to [see others succeed](values.md#see-others-succeed). For managing Slack channels, consider blocking a set period of time to review certain channels that makes the most sense for you (i.e. multiple times a day, daily, weekly).

#### Organizing your Slack sidebar by priority

Consider using Slack's <b>[Starred channel](https://slack.com/help/articles/201331016-Star-channels-and-direct-messages)</b> function to spotlight three categories of channels, its <b>[Mute function](https://slack.com/help/articles/204411433-Mute-channels-and-direct-messages)</b> to quiet channels which are pulling your focus away too often, and most importantly, its **Mark all messages as read** function (easily toggled by pressing `Shift` and `Esc` simultaneously while on a desktop) to achieve an instantly clear slate.

An example of three spotlight channels approach is below. Slack allows you to organize your sidebar of starred channels with <b>[custom sections](https://slack.com/help/articles/360043207674-Organize-your-sidebar-with-custom-sections)</b> to visibly raise or lower their priority level, giving you control over what you see first.

1. Channels important to my job (e.g. a team member in Corporate Marketing may star `#marketing`, `#corp-mktg`, `#newswire`, `#external-comms`, `#website`, `#handbook`)
1. Channels important to GitLab (e.g. `#company-fyi`, `#whats-happening-at-gitlab`, `#team-member-updates`, `#e-group`, `#ceo`, `#new-vacancies`)
1. Channels important to my interests (e.g. `#travel`, `#remote`, `#daily-gratitude`, `#mental_health_aware`, `#intheparenthood`, `#women`, `#diversity_inclusion_and_belonging`)

#### Manage your Slack notifications

Below are helpful links to best practices and tips on managing your notifications and reducing noise in Slack. We encourage you to regularly check your notification settings to ensure you get more notifications of what _is_ important/relevant to you, and less of what _isn't_.

- [GitLab team member Brendan O'leary on how he uses Slack](https://boleary.dev/blog/2020-05-27-how-i-slack.html)

#### Set aside time to work through notifications

Building dedicated time into your day can help minimize the distractions that Slack can create. Consider using a 15 or 30 minute block in your morning or afternoon to enjoy a cup of coffee and catch up on messages you might have missed. When the time you set comes to an end, close out of the Slack app and move on to your next project. Having a set end time can help you feel more in control, and serves as a reminder that [it's impossible to know everything](values.md#its-impossible-to-know-everything)

### General guidelines

1. Everyone can contribute, and while opinions are important to provide perspective, we value [proposals](values.md#make-a-proposal) and [iteration](values.md#iteration). If the subject is of value to the wider community, consider commenting on an existing issue or opening a new [merge request](#everything-starts-with-a-merge-request) instead.
2. In general, you can think of emoji reactions as equivalent to body-language responses we use in real-life conversations, such as nodding your head as encouragement when a verbal (or in Slack, written) response might be too much.
3. In public channels, [threads](https://get.slack.help/hc/en-us/articles/115000769927-Message-threads) are valuable for keeping conversations together. If you want to respond to a question or comment in a channel, please start a thread instead of responding below them in the channel. This helps to keep the discussion in one place where it is easy to follow, and reduces noise as each message in a thread does not result in an unread message for everyone in the channel.
4. Unless you're in an active chat, don't break up a topic into multiple messages as each one will result in a notification which can be disruptive. Use [threads](https://get.slack.help/hc/en-us/articles/115000769927-Message-threads) if you want to provide extra info to the question/comment you posted.
5. If you are having a hard time keeping up with messages, you can update your preferences to have Slack email you all notifications. To change the setting, go to `Preferences > Notifications > When I'm not active on desktop...` and "send me email notifications."
6. If you agree in a message to start a video call (typically by asking "Call?") the person that didn't leave the last comment starts the call. So either respond to the "Call?" request with a video link or say "Yes" and let the other person start it. Do not say "Yes" and start a call 5 seconds later since it is likely you'll both be creating a video call link at the same time.

### Key Slack channels

[TKTK]

## Video Calls 

[TKTK - let's pick one Zoom, Slack, Meet]

## Google Calendar

We recommend you set your Google Calendar access permissions to 'Make available for Inquirer - See all event details'. Consider marking the following appointments as 'Private':

- Personal appointments
- Confidential & sensitive meetings
- 1-1 performance or evaluation meetings
- Meetings on organizational changes

There are several benefits and reasons to sharing your calendar with everyone at the Inquirer:

- Transparency is one of our values and sharing what you work on is in line with our message of "be open about as many things as possible".
- Due to competing priorities, there are small windows of time when our availabilities overlap. If other members need to schedule a new meeting, seeing the details of recurring meetings (such as 1-1s) will allow for more flexibility in scheduling without needing to wait for a confirmation from the team member. This speaks to our value to be more efficient.

If you add blocks of time spent on recurring tasks to your Google Calendar to remind yourself to do things (e.g. "Check Google Analytics"), consider marking yourself "Free" for those events so that coworkers know they may schedule a meeting during that time if they can't find another convenient time.

## Confluence
We will track onboarding activities for new hires in our private Confluence instance. Team members are encouraged to migrate any other DE-created content from Confluence to this handbook.
