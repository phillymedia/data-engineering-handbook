###  3. Create Trusted & Scalable Data Solutions

- We lead with well-tested and accurate Data Solutions
- We operate and maintain the production solutions we create
- We design for the the next 2+ years, while delivering for the Inquirer today

- We believe the best way to align on a complex outcome is to picture it
- Automated tests are the best tests and we implement tests at every step of the data delivery process


### Additional beliefs held by the Data Engineering Team include:
* Everything can and should be defined in code and version controlled
* Data implementations should integrate best practices from DevOps into their workflow
* Partner with each Business function while having a high-quality, maintainable code base
* Open source our code when possible, keeping data security and data sensitivity in mind 
* There is a single source of truth for every analytic question within a company, and it is also important to represent multiple perspectives to provide the most thorough data insights
* [Glue work](https://www.locallyoptimistic.com/post/glue-work/) is important for the health of the team and is recognized individually for the value it provides. We expect [everyone to contribute](/handbook/values/#mission). 
* Focus our limited resources where data will have the greatest impact
* All business users should be able to learn how to interpret and calculate simple statistics
